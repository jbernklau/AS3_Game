Flash game done in the fall semester of 2012 with a group of two others and myself. This project was my most difficult project to date.

The game itself is not working properly and some of the classes/assets are unused. My role in the project was level one code and graphics, logic/math and coding of the shooting gun in the boss level, and various other tasks.
